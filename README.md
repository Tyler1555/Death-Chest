Death-Chest
===========

A Minecraft mod that dumps a player's items in their chest on death

Building
========
If you want to port this to a different version or add dragons to it or something, use these steps:
1. Grab the latest src build of Minecraft Forge and setup your workspace
2. Clone this repo to your computer and add it to the src folder
3. Make your desired modifications(Or none at all if you just wanted to play around with new features)
4. Recompile. This mod has no dependencies other than Forge/FML so recompiling it is like recompiling any other mod
